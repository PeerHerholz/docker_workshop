# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the "Software containers in neuroscience research" workshop conducted at INSERT_INSTITUTE_LOCATION_HERE, we're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow the workshop, as well as respective materials. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/docker_workshop) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain analyses via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is plugin](https://web.hypothes.is/) with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/).

# Software containers in neuroscience research
  

You can checkout the respective sections:

* [An overview]()

   What's this workshop about and how is it organized?

* [Setup]()

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline]()

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Prerequisites]()

   All things gotta start somewhere and using software containers in neuroscience research are of course no exceptions to that, especially since a certain amount of digital literacy, programming, etc. is required. 
   Here, we gathered some resources folks can check out in preparation for the course or just for fun.

* [Software containers - a super short introduction]()


* [Installation & Trouble shooting]()

* [Quickstarting your container expertise]()

* [Management of software containers]()

* [Creating software containers]()

* [Software containers & data]()

* [Automating software containers]()

* [Creating your own software container]()

* [Code of Conduct]()

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.
